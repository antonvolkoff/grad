Graph database loosely follows the Hexastore approach as presented in the article:
[Hexastore: sextuple indexing for semantic web data management C Weiss, P Karras, A Bernstein - Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2008.](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/1/1453965.pdf). As a backend for storing
data it uses [boltdb](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt).

## TODO

[ ] Add meaningful tests
